# dynamic-analysis-of-hand-crane-using-MATLAB-Simscape
This project performs dynamic analysis of a basic hand crane design.


MATLAB can perform complex dynamic analysis for systems that we cannot perform with hand calculation. The main porpuse of this project is that: An hand crane was designed with static machine element design rules but always there will be unexpected forces which system can be faced. With using MATLAB basic and complex systems can be analyzed easily.

Simulink Simcape Toolbox was needed to perform these analysis. To begin the project the first step was the drawing of the subparts of the assembly. After drawing subparts creating assembly and giving relation for parts was needed. After that we create a .xml file which with this file MATLAB can create a data file for creating an Simulink scheme.In the link which in below you can all steps for installation of the toolbox and creating a Simulink scheme.

All Solidworks and MATLAB files are provided in the repository. Do not hesitate to ask about project I will be happy to help you.  

This project was presented as MKT3821-Machine Elements Course in Yildiz Technical University. Thanks to Mehmet İşcan who TA of the course.
